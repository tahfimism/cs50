# CS50 Week 1 ‚Äì C: Hello, World

This folder contains my solutions to the **Week 1 problem sets** of Harvard's [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/), where we transitioned from Scratch to C programming.
It contains the other practice codes as well.
---

## üß† What This Week Covered:
- Introduction to **C programming language**
- Using **functions**, **variables**, and **conditions**
- Basics of **loops**, **input/output**, and **logic**

### ‚úÖ `mario_less.c`  
- **Goal**: Print a pyramid of blocks (`#`) like in Mario, aligned right.
- **Concepts**: Loops, conditionals, input validation.

### ‚úÖ `mario_more.c`  
- **Goal**: Print a pyramid with a gap in the middle of blocks (`#`) like in Mario.
- **Concepts**: Loops, conditionals, input validation.

### ‚úÖ `cash.c`  
- **Goal**: Calculate the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount.
