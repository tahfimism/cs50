# p/w7/ README

This folder contains Python scripts for Week 7 exercises and projects. Here is a description of each file:

## Main Scripts
- **format.py**: Prompts for a name in the format "Last, First" and prints it as "First Last" using regular expressions.
- **validate.py**: Prompts for an email address and prints whether it is valid (ending in .edu) using regular expressions.

---

Each script is a standalone program for practicing regular expressions and string formatting in Python.
