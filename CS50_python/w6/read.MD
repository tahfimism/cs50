# p/w6/ README

This folder contains Python scripts for Week 6 exercises and projects. Here is a description of each file:

## Main Scripts
- **name.py**: Reads names from a file and prints them in sorted order. (Commented code shows how to append a new name to the file.)
- **image.py**: Uses the Pillow library to open an image, rotate it, apply a blur filter, and save the result. (Note: There is a typo: `inport` should be `import`, and `image.open` should be `Image.open`.)
- **students.py**: Reads a CSV file of students and prints each student's name and school.
- **ece.py**: Plots a 5Hz sine wave using NumPy and Matplotlib as a fun ECE project starter.
- **stu_into.py**: Prompts for a name and school, then writes the information to a CSV file using the csv.DictWriter class. (Note: There is a typo: `writter` should be `writer`.)

Each script is a standalone program for practicing file I/O, CSV handling, image processing, and plotting in Python.
