# p/w8/ README

This folder contains Python scripts for Week 8 exercises and problem sets, including code and tests. Here is a description of each file:

## Main Scripts
- **hello.py**: Prompts for a name and prints a greeting using the first name.
- **student.py**: Defines a `People` class and a `Student` subclass with properties for name and house, including validation. Prompts for user input and prints a description of the student.

## psets/
- **jar.py**: Implements a `Jar` class with methods to deposit and withdraw cookies, and properties for capacity and size. Raises errors for overfilling or emptying the jar.
- **test_jar.py**: Tests the `Jar` class for initialization, deposit, withdraw, and string representation.
- **seasons.py**: Calculates a person's age in minutes from their birth date and prints it in words using the `inflect` library.
- **test_seasons.py**: Tests the `minute` function from `seasons.py` for valid, invalid, and edge case dates.

Each script is a standalone program for practicing object-oriented programming, properties, error handling, and unit testing in Python.
