# p/w0/ README

This folder contains introductory Python programs, each designed to practice basic programming concepts. Below is a description of each file and its purpose:

## calcu.py
A simple calculator that prompts the user for two numbers (`x` and `y`), adds them, rounds the result, and prints the value of `x` with comma formatting. (Note: The code only prints `x`, not the sum.)

## hello.py
Prompts the user for their name, formats it (strips whitespace and capitalizes), and prints a personalized greeting using a helper function.

## psets/
This subfolder contains small problem set scripts:

- **faces.py**: Reads user input and replaces ":)" with a smiley emoji and ":(" with a sad emoji, then prints the result.
- **playback.py**: Reads user input and replaces every space with three dots (`...`), then prints the result.
- **indoor.py**: Reads user input, strips whitespace, converts it to lowercase, and prints it. Useful for simulating an "indoor voice."
- **tip.py**: Asks the user for a meal cost and a tip percentage, then calculates and prints the tip amount. Includes helper functions to convert dollar and percent strings to floats.
- **einstein.py**: Prompts the user for a mass value (`m`), computes the energy using Einstein's equation (E = mcÂ²), and prints the result.

---

Each file is a standalone script and can be run individually. These exercises are designed to reinforce user input, string manipulation, arithmetic, and function basics in Python.
