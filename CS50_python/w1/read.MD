# p/w1/ README

This folder contains Python scripts for Week 1 exercises and problem sets. Here is a description of each file:

## compare.py
Prompts the user for a number and prints whether it is even or odd using a helper function `is_even`.

## house.py
Prompts the user for a name and prints a custom greeting based on the name using Python's `match` statement.

### psets/
- **deep.py**: Asks the user for the answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. Accepts "42", "forty two", or "forty-two" (case-insensitive) as correct answers.
- **meal.py**: Asks the user for a time and prints whether it is breakfast, lunch, or dinner time based on the input. Includes a helper function to convert time strings to float hours.
- **bank.py**: Prompts for a greeting and prints a dollar amount based on whether the greeting starts with "hello", "h", or something else.
- **interpreter.py**: A simple calculator that parses and evaluates expressions like `x + y`, `x - y`, `x * y`, or `x / y`.
- **extensions.py**: Asks for a file name and prints the corresponding MIME type based on the file extension.

Each script is a standalone program for practicing user input, conditionals, and basic Python syntax.
