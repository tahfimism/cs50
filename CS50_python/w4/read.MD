# p/w4/ README

This folder contains Python scripts for Week 4 exercises and problem sets. Here is a description of each file:

## coin-flip.py
Simulates flipping a coin 100,000 times and prints the number of heads and tails.

## stat.py
Takes a search term as a command-line argument, queries the iTunes API for songs, and prints the names of the top 10 tracks found.

## psets/
- **adieu.py**: Prompts the user for names (until EOF), then prints a farewell message using proper English grammar (with the help of the `inflect` library).
- **bitcoin.py**: Takes a number as a command-line argument, fetches the current price of Bitcoin, and prints the value of that many Bitcoins in USD.
- **emojize.py**: Prompts the user for text and prints it with emoji aliases converted to actual emojis (using the `emoji` library).
- **figlet.py**: Prints user input in a randomly chosen (or user-specified) ASCII art font using the `pyfiglet` library. Handles command-line arguments for font selection.
- **game.py**: Implements a number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and a user-specified level.
- **professor.py**: A math quiz that asks the user 10 addition questions of varying difficulty, tracks the score, and gives up to 3 tries per question.

Each script is a standalone program for practicing randomness, APIs, string formatting, and user interaction in Python.
