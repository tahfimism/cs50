# p/w3/ README

This folder contains Python scripts for Week 3 exercises and problem sets. Here is a description of each file:

## fuel.py
Prompts the user for a fuel fraction (e.g., 3/4), validates the input, and prints the fuel level as a percentage. Special cases: prints "F" for full (99% or more) and "E" for empty (1% or less).

## outdated.py
Prompts the user for a date in either MM/DD/YYYY or "Month Day, Year" format, validates and parses the input, and (in the full code) would print the date in a standardized format. (Note: code is truncated in the preview.)

## taqueria.py
Implements a menu for a taqueria. Prompts the user for menu items, adds up the total, and prints the running total after each valid item. Handles EOF to end input.

## grocery.py
Prompts the user to enter grocery items (one per line), then prints a sorted list of items and their counts in uppercase. Handles EOF to end input.

Each script is a standalone program for practicing input validation, dictionaries, string manipulation, and loops in Python.
